## Commonly Used Charts and Graphs

1. Bar Chart: Displays data using rectangular bars of varying lengths, with the length of each bar representing the data value.

2. Column Chart: Similar to a bar chart, but with vertical bars instead of horizontal bars.

3. Line Chart: Shows data points connected by lines, useful for displaying trends over time.

4. Area Chart: Similar to a line chart, but the area beneath the line is shaded, making it easier to visualize cumulative totals.

5. Pie Chart: Represents data as a circle divided into sectors, with each sector representing a proportion of the whole.

6. Scatter Plot: Displays individual data points as dots on a two-dimensional plane, showing the relationship between two variables.

7. Bubble Chart: Similar to a scatter plot, but the size of each dot represents a third variable.

8. Histogram: Represents the distribution of continuous data by dividing it into bins and displaying the frequency or count of data points in each bin.

9. Box Plot: Displays the distribution of a dataset using quartiles, showing the median, interquartile range, and any outliers.

10. Heat Map: Represents data using colors to indicate values in a matrix, where each cell represents a combination of two variables.

11. Treemap: Displays hierarchical data using nested rectangles, with each rectangle's size representing a proportion of the whole.

12. Waterfall Chart: Shows how an initial value is affected by intermediate positive or negative values, leading to a final value.

13. Gantt Chart: Used for project management, displaying tasks, their durations, and dependencies as horizontal bars on a timeline.

14. Radar Chart: Displays multivariate data on a two-dimensional plane in the form of a polygon, with each variable represented by a spoke.

15. Sankey Diagram: Visualizes the flow of data or resources between different entities, with the width of the flow representing the quantity.

16. Pareto Chart: Combines a bar chart and line graph to show the cumulative frequency of different categories, highlighting the most significant ones.

17. Funnel Chart: Represents a sequential process, showing the progressive reduction of values at each stage.

18. Bullet Chart: Displays performance data against a target or benchmark, showing qualitative ranges and actual values.

19. Radar Chart: Displays multivariate data on a two-dimensional plane in the form of a polygon, with each variable represented by a spoke.

20. Network Diagram: Represents the relationship between different entities using nodes and edges.

## More Complex and Important Charts

1. Choropleth Map: Uses different shades or patterns to represent data values across geographic regions, such as countries or states.

2. Network Graph: Visualizes relationships between entities as nodes and connections as edges, with the ability to represent complex networks.

3. Word Cloud: Displays words or phrases related to a topic, with word size indicating frequency or importance.

4. Sunburst Chart: Displays hierarchical data as a series of concentric circles, with each circle representing a level of the hierarchy.

5. Tree Diagram: Illustrates hierarchical relationships between categories or concepts, branching out like a tree structure.

6. Streamgraph: Shows the change in composition or proportions of multiple categories over time, using stacked areas.

7. Polar Chart: Represents data on a circular grid, suitable for comparing multiple variables simultaneously.

8. Cohort Analysis: Visualizes the behavior or characteristics of different groups over time, typically represented in a line chart or stacked bar chart.

9. Population Pyramid: Represents the distribution of age and gender within a population, with age groups displayed as horizontal bars.

10. Radar Spider Chart: Displays multiple variables as axes radi
